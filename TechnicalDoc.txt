Technical Design and System Architecture of a Vertical Skyscraper Simulation in Python
The pursuit of replicating the intricate mechanics of vertical urban management within a computational environment requires a synthesis of architectural theory, discrete-event simulation, and agent-based behavioral modeling. Building a modern simulation in Python that pays homage to the seminal 1994 title SimTower involves more than mere graphical replication; it necessitates a deep understanding of the systemic interdependencies between transportation throughput, economic sustainability, and the psychological state of a virtual population. The project, hereafter referred to as the Tower Simulation, serves as a technical blueprint for implementing a complex high-rise ecosystem where the primary antagonist is not a rival entity but the entropic nature of logistics and tenant dissatisfaction.   

Structural Integrity and the Spatial Coordinate System
The foundational layer of the Tower Simulation is the spatial grid, which defines the physical boundaries of the skyscraper and the possible interactions between its various modules. Unlike traditional city-builders that utilize a top-down Cartesian plane for zoning, this simulation adopts a vertical cross-section approach. The coordinate system is defined by two primary axes: the vertical floor level and the horizontal segment.   

The Segment-Based Grid Logic
The horizontal axis of the tower is divided into discrete units known as segments. A segment represents the smallest unit of construction and is the width of the basic floor tool. The internal logic of the tower must support a maximum width of 375 segments. This spatial constraint dictates the layout of every facility, from small hotel rooms to expansive cinema complexes. The vertical axis is comprised of levels, spanning from a subterranean depth of B10 to a height of 100 floors above ground.

Physical Attribute	Technical Specification	
Maximum Height	100 Levels Above Ground	
Maximum Depth	10 Levels Below Ground (B1-B10)	
Maximum Width	375 Horizontal Segments	
Segment Unit	Smallest Construction Increment	
Cathedral Placement	Restricted to Level 100	
Metro Placement	Restricted to Sub-Levels (3-floor height)


The spatial mapping engine must treat floors as contiguous nodes in a graph. For any given segment at $(x, y)$, the engine checks for the presence of a "room" or "object".4 Rooms represent non-overlapping functional spaces such as offices or condominiums, while objects represent transit mechanisms like elevators and stairs that may overlap with room segments to facilitate movement.10 The implementation of this grid in Python typically involves a multi-dimensional array or a quadtree structure to optimize spatial queries, especially as the population scales toward the 15,000 Sim threshold required for the final "Tower" designation.

Subterranean Development and Structural Foundations
Development below ground level introduces unique engineering challenges and specialized facility requirements. The simulation restricts certain modules, such as condominiums and offices, from being placed in the sub-levels B1 through B10. Instead, these floors are reserved for infrastructure and high-traffic public facilities. The Metro Station, a massive structure that serves as a primary population injector in the late game, requires three levels of vertical space and can only be situated at the lowest levels of the tower.

The transition between levels is not merely a matter of vertical placement; the game engine must account for the structural "Lobby" on Level 1, which acts as the primary entry point for all Sims. From a technical standpoint, the Lobby is the only structure allowed on Level 1 initially, and it serves as the master node for all transportation pathfinding. High-level players often utilize a "multi-level lobby" technique, which can be implemented by holding specific input modifiers to create a 2-level or 3-level entrance, thereby altering the visual and functional capacity of the ground floor.

Temporal Dynamics and Behavioral Scheduling
The Tower Simulation operates on a compressed temporal cycle that governs both the economic engine and the movement of non-player characters (NPCs) or "Sims." This cycle is essential for creating the peaks and troughs in traffic that test the tower's transportation infrastructure. 

The Chronological Framework
A year in the simulation is divided into four quarters, and each quarter consists of three specific days: Weekday 1, Weekday 2, and the Weekend. This 12-day annual cycle ensures that financial outcomes and population shifts occur rapidly enough to allow for iterative design adjustments.

Game Time Period,Duration / rollover,Technical Significance
Day,24 Hours (Real-time progression),NPC movement and daily income
Week,"3 Days (WD1, WD2, WE)",Behavioral shifts (Work vs. Leisure)
Quarter,4 Weeks,Rent collection and maintenance triggers
Year,12 Days,Annual financial reporting

The daily schedule is the most granular level of the simulation and dictates the activation of facility modules. For example, the workday for offices begins strictly at 9:00 AM, creating a massive influx of Sims into the tower via the lobby or Metro Station. This is followed by a lunch hour at noon, which triggers internal movement from offices to fast food locations. The synchronization of these events requires an event-driven architecture within the Python engine, where a central "World Clock" broadcasts signals to all subscribed modules.

Behavioral Triggers and Daily Events
The simulation's realism is enhanced by the cyclical patterns of its inhabitants. Office workers are active during the day, whereas hotel guests and restaurant patrons dominate the night-time traffic. On weekends, the absence of office workers shifts the burden to leisure facilities like the cinema and retail shops.

The timing of these events is critical for the player's financial management. For instance, condominiums can only be purchased by Sims between 9:00 AM and 1:00 PM on weekdays. This specific window allows savvy tower managers to manipulate prices outside of these hours. If a condo is built after 9:00 PM, the price can be adjusted to its maximum level before the next morning's sales window opens. Similarly, hotel guests check out between 6:30 AM and noon, after which the rooms become "dirty" and require housekeeping before the evening check-in window.


Economic Systems and Resource Management
The economic engine of the Tower Simulation is a multi-tiered system that balances immediate capital gains against long-term operational costs. Revenue is categorized into one-time sales, daily service income, and quarterly rent.   

Revenue Streams and Profitability
The most immediate source of capital in the early game is the construction and sale of condominiums. A condominium costs $80,000 to build and can be sold for a default price of $150,000, with a maximum adjustment up to $200,000. While this provides a rapid influx of cash, it carries significant risk. If conditions in the tower deteriorate—due to noise from nearby restaurants or long elevator wait times—residents will move out, forcing the player to buy back the unit at its original sale price. This can trigger a "bankruptcy spiral" if a mass sell-off occurs during a financial deficit.   

Offices provide the most stable long-term income through quarterly rent, which typically ranges from $2,000 to $15,000 depending on the evaluation status of the unit. Retail facilities, such as shops and fast food restaurants, generate daily income based on an evaluation metric.

Facility Type,Initial Cost,Primary Revenue Model,Revenue Thresholds
Condominium,"$80,000",One-time Sale,"$50,000 - $200,000"
Office,"$40,000",Quarterly Rent,"$2,000 - $15,000"
Fast Food,"$100,000",Daily Service,"-$3,000 to $5,000"
Restaurant,"$200,000",Daily Service,"-$6,000 to $10,000"
Retail Shop,"$100,000",Daily Rent,"$4,000 - $20,000"
Party Hall,"$100,000",Daily Flat Fee,"$20,000"
Hotel Single,"$20,000",Daily Occupancy,"$500 - $3,000"

Maintenance and Infrastructure Costs
Every facility and transportation object in the tower incurs ongoing maintenance expenses, which are deducted at the end of each quarter. Standard elevators cost approximately $10,000 per car per quarter, while express elevators cost $20,000 per car. Lobbies also incur a maintenance fee of $3 per segment.

Transportation and Logistics: The Core Engine
The definitive technical achievement of a high-rise simulation is the elevator dispatching system. In the context of the Tower Simulation, this system is not merely a utility but the primary factor determining the "stress" levels of the population.   

The Elevator Dispatch Algorithm (SCAN Variation)
The core logic of elevator movement follows the SCAN algorithm, commonly used in hard drive scheduling. An elevator car will continue to move in its current direction as long as there are "calls" (requests from Sims on a floor or from within the car) in that direction.   

Directional Phase: If the car is moving Up, it will stop at every floor where a Sim has pressed the "Up" button or where a passenger inside the car has selected that floor.   

Boundary Check: Once it reaches the highest requested floor, it checks for any pending "Down" calls below it.   

Idle State: If no calls remain, the car returns to its "Home Level".   

The simulation adds complexity through user-definable parameters: "Waiting Car Response" and "Standard Floor Departure". The Waiting Car Response setting determines how many levels a moving car can be from a waiting Sim before the system dispatches an entirely new idle car to that floor. The Standard Floor Departure setting defines the minimum amount of time (in game seconds) a car must wait after loading a Sim to allow others nearby to board.

Elevator Parameter,Typical Value,Functional Impact
Waiting Car Response,1 - 5 Floors,Reduces new car deployment; increases wait time
Standard Floor Departure,30 - 60s,Groups Sims together; reduces car trips
Shaft Limit,24 Total,Hard limit on vertical throughput
Car Limit,8 per Shaft,Vertical stacking within a single shaft

Multi-Modal Transit and Trip Logic
The simulation restricts each Sim's journey to a maximum of four "trips" or transit legs. A trip is defined as a single use of an elevator, stairwell, or escalator. For example, a Sim living on the 40th floor who wants to reach the Metro Station at B10 might take a standard elevator from floor 40 to the floor 30 skylobby (Trip 1), an express elevator from floor 30 to floor 1 (Trip 2), and a set of stairs from floor 1 to the Metro (Trip 3). If a destination requires more than four trips, the Sim will be unable to reach it, resulting in abandonment or failure to use the facility.   

Escalators are the preferred method of travel for Sims over short distances (up to 7 levels, though 5 is the practical limit for consistent satisfaction). Unlike elevators, escalators and stairs have effectively infinite capacity for continuous flow, but they are limited to a total of 64 units per tower. This encourages a "hub-and-spoke" design where express elevators connect 15-floor blocks, and local movement within those blocks is handled by standard elevators or escalators.   

Sim Psychology and Stress Modeling
The primary fail-state in the simulation is the "Stress" or "Anger" level of the tenants. This is a purely time-based metric that measures the duration a Sim has been waiting for a transportation resource.   

The Mechanics of Dissatisfaction
Stress is cumulative and is visualized through a color-changing sprite. When a Sim begins waiting at an elevator bank, they are colored black. As the wait time exceeds certain thresholds, the sprite turns pink, and then a glowing red. If a Sim reaches the "Red" state of anger, it negatively impacts the evaluation of their home or workplace.   

The system does not measure the total travel time from point A to point B; rather, it exclusively measures the "dead time" spent waiting at a lobby. This leads to a critical design insight: travel via stairs or escalators generates zero stress because there is no waiting time involved. Consequently, an optimal tower layout minimizes elevator demand for the highest-density populations, such as office workers during the morning and lunch peaks.   

Environmental Factors and Noise
Sim satisfaction is also influenced by the aesthetic and acoustic balance of the building. Certain facilities are categorized as "Noisy," including retail shops, restaurants, and fast food joints. Condominiums and hotel rooms are highly sensitive to this noise. Building a noisy restaurant directly adjacent to a block of condos will lead to immediate evaluation drops, forcing the player to either relocate the tenants or the facility. To mitigate this, offices can be used as a "buffer" layer, as they generate moderate noise that is more compatible with commercial areas while still separating the most sensitive residents from the loud public zones.   

Comprehensive Facility Modules
Each room in the tower is a complex module with specific inputs, outputs, and requirements. The simulation must track the state of every individual unit in real-time.

Housing and Residential Modules: The Condominium
Condominiums represent the only permanent housing in the tower. Each unit increases the population by 3 Sims. They are unique in that they generate a one-time lump sum of income upon sale but provide no ongoing rent.   

A significant technical detail is the "CondoGlitch." During a bomb threat, if a condo is currently unsold, "phantom sims" may occupy the unit during the event, causing it to immediately gain a "Conditions are terrible" status. This forces the player to buy back an unsold property, which is a logic bug that must be addressed in the Python clone through state-checking during event triggers.   

Corporate Modules: The Office
Offices are the backbone of the tower's economy and its primary population driver. Each office accommodates 6 workers. At the 3-star level, office workers begin to demand parking spaces and medical centers. If a medical center is not provided near the office block, workers will be forced to travel long distances during the workday, increasing elevator congestion and lowering their workplace evaluation.   

Hospitality Modules: Hotels and Housekeeping
Hotel rooms are rented on a daily basis and represent a high-maintenance, high-reward revenue stream.

Twin Room,"$50,000",2,"$4,500",3-Star Rating
Suite,"$100,000",2,"$9,000",3-Star Rating; Parking Space

The management of hotel rooms is inextricably linked to the Housekeeping and Service Elevator systems. Each housekeeping station provides six housekeepers, each of whom can service up to 19 rooms per day.9 Crucially, housekeepers will only clean rooms until 5:00 PM and will not start cleaning a new room after 4:30 PM.9 If a room is not cleaned, it remains "dirty" and cannot be rented the next night; if left dirty for multiple days, it may become infested with roaches, necessitating its demolition.9 To optimize this, housekeepers should be connected to no more than 6 floors via a service elevator to ensure they do not waste time on "poor pathfinding decisions" between disparate hotel blocks.5Entertainment and Commercial ModulesLeisure facilities are essential for attracting the foot traffic needed to reach high population milestones.Fast Food: These are 16-segment wide units that serve as the primary destination for office workers during lunch.5 They earn income based on a color-coded evaluation (Red: -$3,000, Yellow: +$2,000, Blue: +$5,000).9Restaurants: Larger 24-segment units that only open after 5:00 PM.9 They are twice as profitable as fast food but serve a different demographic (hotel guests and residents).9Retail Shops: These 12-segment units generate income based on a combination of rent price and customer count.19 If a shop fails to maintain its "Blue" evaluation due to high rent or low traffic, it will be abandoned.19Cinema: A massive entertainment module (31 segments by 2 floors) that requires movie rotation.4 New movies cost $300,000 and classics cost $150,000.9 The information window provides feedback such as "It's a Sellout!" or "Terrible Sales, change the movie," which directly impacts the cinema's $10,000 daily income potential.9Specialized Facilities: Cathedral and MetroThe final stage of the tower's progression involves massive infrastructure projects. The Cathedral, costing $3,000,000, can only be built on level 100 once a 5-star rating is achieved.8 It has zero capacity and provides no income, but its presence is mandatory for the final "Tower" rating.4 The achievement of this rank is triggered specifically when a wedding takes place at the Cathedral while the tower's population exceeds 15,000.8The Metro Station, located in the sub-levels, is the ultimate population booster.6 It costs $1,000,000 and incurs a $100,000 quarterly maintenance fee.9 It injects a large number of Sims into the tower at the start of each workday, placing extreme pressure on the express elevator shafts that service the B1-B3 levels.6Software Engineering Considerations for the Python ImplementationDeveloping this simulation in Python requires careful selection of libraries to ensure that the rendering loop can handle thousands of concurrent NPC entities and a complex grid of rooms.Choice of Game Engine: Pygame vs. ArcadeThe architectural decision between Pygame and Arcade hinges on the expected population density of the tower.Pygame (SDL-based): Historically the most popular Python game library.29 It is highly flexible and runs on the CPU.29 However, because it lacks built-in hardware acceleration for sprite batching, it may struggle when rendering a 110-floor tower filled with 15,000 Sims, each requiring their own pathfinding logic.29Arcade (OpenGL-based): Built on top of OpenGL 3.3+, Arcade offloads much of the rendering to the GPU.29 It is inherently faster for simulations with many moving objects.29 It also supports modern Python features like type-hinting and decorators, which leads to cleaner code when implementing the complex state machines required for Sims and elevator dispatching.29Data Structures for Pathfinding and StateThe Tower Simulation is essentially a graph problem. Each floor is a node, and each elevator/stair/escalator is an edge.Adjacency List: The simulation should maintain an adjacency list that is updated every time a player adds or removes a transit object.Dijkstra's Algorithm / A*: When a Sim is spawned, a path is calculated from their entry point to their destination using a weighted search.31 The weights must change dynamically based on the "wait time" at each elevator bank to allow Sims to choose less congested routes if available.31Entity-Component-System (ECS): For 15,000 Sims, an ECS approach is recommended. This decouples the Sim's data (position, home floor, stress level) from the systems that process them (movement system, stress update system, rendering system).Handling Random Events and IntegrityThe simulation must include a system for random events, such as terrorist bomb threats or the discovery of gold underground.2 A bomb threat requires the player to decide whether to pay a ransom or deploy security to find the device.2 Gold discovery provides a significant one-time financial bonus.2 These events are not just visual flair; they test the tower's security infrastructure (Security Stations) and can cause mass evacuation, testing the limits of the ground-level egress capacity.2Progression Milestones and Star RatingsThe simulation uses a star rating system to pace the player's progress and manage the complexity of the tower.1Star RatingPopulation RequirementMandatory Item(s)Features Unlocked1 StarInitialNoneOffice, Condo, Fast Food, Std Elevator2 Stars300 SimsNoneSingle Hotel, Security, Housekeeping3 Stars1,000 Sims1 Security StationTwin/Suite Hotel, Retail, Cinema, Escalators, Express Elevators4 Stars5,000 SimsSatisfied VIP; Medical Center; RecyclingMetro Station5 Stars10,000 SimsMetro StationCathedralTOWER15,000 SimsCathedral on L100; Wedding EventFinal Completion8Advancing from 3 to 4 stars is the most significant hurdle. It requires not just a population increase but also a favorable rating from a VIP guest.2 The VIP visit is a triggered event where an important guest stays in a hotel suite.28 Their satisfaction is calculated based on the suite's cleanliness, the absence of noise, and the efficiency of the transit to the ground floor.2 If the VIP is satisfied, the tower receives a star; if they are unhappy, the player may have to wait multiple quarters for another opportunity.2Technical Conclusion and RecommendationsThe creation of a SimTower clone in Python is a high-level software engineering task that demands rigorous attention to logistical throughput and agent behavioral modeling. The tower is a "Vertical Empire" where the player’s primary role is that of a systems optimizer.1Key recommendations for the implementation include:Prioritize the Elevator Algorithm: The SCAN-based dispatching system is the heart of the game. Even small inefficiencies in wait times will cascade into tower-wide tenant abandonment.6Optimize the Python Rendering Loop: Using the Arcade library to leverage GPU acceleration is essential for maintaining a smooth frame rate with 10,000+ active Sim entities.29Implement Robust State Checking: To avoid legacy bugs like the "Lobby to Eat" or "CondoGlitch," the game logic must explicitly verify pathing weights and room occupancy states during transition events.9Balance the Early Game Economy: Use the condominium sale mechanics to provide the player with "loans" to fund the infrastructure necessary for the high-density office and hotel modules of the mid-game.14By strictly following these spatial, economic, and behavioral guidelines, the developer can produce a simulation that is both a faithful tribute and a technically sound modern implementation of the vertical city-building genre.1 Success in the Tower Simulation is ultimately defined by the achievement of a stable, 15,000-Sim ecosystem, crowned by a cathedral on the 100th floor, representing the pinnacle of architectural and logistical mastery.
